Hi my name's Martin!

This is a basic version of TETRIS I made using Javascript. 

The controls are very simple: 
- Left arrow: move the block to the left.
- Right arrow: move the block to the right.
- Up arrow: rotate the block (each Tetromino have 4 rotations).
- Down arrow: increase the speed of the blocks.

Each time you make a line you win 100 points and if you reach HEAVEN it's a GAME OVER.
